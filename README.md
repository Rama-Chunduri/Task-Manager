## Project Description
- This project is important to us because time management is a crucial step in being productive. As computer science students, we all struggle with remembering due dates for assignments and meetings. Designing this project would not only help us keep track of our priorities but can also be helpful to others. 
-The languages that we will be using for this project would be C++ and Visual Studio Code.
- Input: Name of user, password, name of task, description, due dates, tags, and priority of tasks.
- Output: A visible schedule which is printed in order of due dates which shows all the tasks , due dates, priorities, tags, descriptions and all information about their tasks. They will also get automatic remainders which are displayed on the screen 24 hours before each task is due.
The main features of this project are: It allows the user to organize their schedule by adding different tasks and they will be notified 24 hours before the time of the task. They can add a description to their tasks, categorize them using tags, give them certain priorities and set due dates for the tasks as well.

 > ## Phase III

> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.
